    "Model building is the process of creating machine learning models to predict customer churn based on the preprocessed and engineered data. Model building is a crucial step in the customer churn prediction analysis process, as it involves selecting an appropriate algorithm, training the model on the training data, and evaluating its performance on the test data. The following are some common steps in model building:\n",

    "1. Algorithm Selection: Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm based on the characteristics of the data and the problem being solved. Common algorithms for customer churn prediction include logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting, and neural networks.\n",

    "3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust the hyperparameters of the model to optimize its performance. Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data and must be set manually. Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate, number of trees in a random forest, or the regularization parameter in logistic regression.\n",
